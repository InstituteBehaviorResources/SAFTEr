Description: Formats sleep data from period based sleep with start and stop datetimes and creates a table of 
    1 Minute epochs. The SAFTE model can then be applied to this data and plotted on a single Y axis plot or a dual y-axis
    plot for comparison to outside observations or data. Creates a table that can also be exported for further analyzation.
